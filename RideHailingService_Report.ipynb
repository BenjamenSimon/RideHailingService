The riders are charged a fixed rate of $30 per ride, and I have been tasked to propose a pricing strategy to maximise the profit of the business over the 12 months, given some contraints and assumptions.

    "- There are a total of 10,000 riders in Toledo.\n",
    "- The service begins with 0 riders active.\n",
    "- Each month a maximum of 1,000 new riders can join the service and be eligible to request rides.\n",
    "- In the first month that a rider is active, they request an average of 1 ride per month (with the number of rides requested coming from a Poisson distribution).\n",
    "- In each subsequent month, riders request rides based on a Poisson distribution where lambda is the number of rides that they found a *match* for in the previous month.\n",
    "- If a rider finds no matches in a month (which may happen either because they request no rides or because they request rides and find no matches), they leave the service and never return.\n",

    "The Data:\n",
    "- Data was provided from a similar service denoting what the pay, P, was and whether the ride was accepted.\n",
    "- From the exploratory analysis, there is a strong positive non-linear relationship between the probability of acceptance and the rate of pay, as such a logistic regression model was fit to the data to estimate the probability that a given rate of pay would be accepted.\n",

    "The Model:\n",
    "- The model is simulated in discrete time with 1-month units.\n",
    "- The population of riders are considered homogeneous and exchangable, but with unique histories. \n",
    "- No features of the driver population are considered, just the probability of acceptance based on the data.\n",
    "- The maximum number (1,000) of riders is assumed to be acquired each month, at the start of the month, so their rate of requests are that of a whole month."

A higher rate of acceptance leads to more riders active and more ride requests, but lowers the profit per ride, or may even lead to a loss per ride. With this in mind I developed 3 different models to explore this relationship and identify if a non-uniform strategy could increase profits."

A portion of riders will naturally leave the service without any possible remedy if they make no requests in a month, but some will leave because their requests weren't accepted, and these cases are potentially avoidable. If an individual leaves in month 1 because their request wasn't accepted, then we are potentially missing out on 11 months of additional revenue, which is quite substantial.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model works by attempting to maximise the number of riders who remain active, and then maximise profits on additional rides. If a rider has yet to have an accepted ride that month, the pay for their current request is at a premium (possibly even a loss) to maximise the probability of acceptance and guarantee they will stay active, any additional rides requested by this rider that month are payed at a value to optimise profit."

    "As in the adaptive rate, we consider the relationship between the number of active riders and the rate of pay/acceptance rate. As previously noted some riders will naturally leave the service because they make no requests in a month, the likelihood of this is increased the lower the rate of requests for an individual, and the rate of requests of an individual is related to the number of accepted requests of the previous month. Thus this strategy focuses on maximising the rate of requests of users for a period using a low proft/loss pay rate, to keep as many users active as possible, and then switching to a high profit rate. Unfortunately a high rate of requests could take months to build up, and then if the high profit pay rate leads to low accetances, the high request rate will disappear."

The sample size was not incredibly large but it is reasonable to assume that drivers will not take a job that is below a certain threshold, and would never do a job for free, where as this model predicts the acceptance of jobs at a $0.00 pay rate is 0.18%. We also saw similar behaviour at the other extreme. For this reason I believe the model should only be trusted for the interpolated bounds, for instance between $5.00 and $50.00."

    "From the above we can evidently see that the optimal strategy for maximising the profit of this service under these assumptions is to have a fixed rate price in the region of $24 - $26, and further simulations could identify a global maxima to two deicimal places. Even the special cases with more freedom to adapt the rate were both optomised by the same fixed rate across the whole period. There are other more complex adaptations of course, such as a bait and switch rate that changed every month, or an adaptive rate that adapted more intelligently or more actively, ie. focusing on those with high request rates. However, I would theorise that given the evidence we have seen so far, and the relationships present in the data, that these would also be optimised by the same fixed rate.\n",

Likewise some of the assumptions of the model, such as the highly varying rate of requests month to month, may prove to be invalid."
